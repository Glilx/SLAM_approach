# SLAM_approach

The robot moves from one point to another through 4 main points:
- position
- sensor
- map
- path

So the second task in the ROS path is to use Turtlebo3's approach with SLAM to generate and save a map
First install the system through the following codes inside the ROS:
Install TurtleBot3 Packages
- sudo apt install ros-modilc-dynamixel-sdk

- sudo apt install ros-modilc-turtlebot3-msgs

- sudo apt install ros-modilc-turtlebot3

We see in the pictures when the code is running and the robot is moving
